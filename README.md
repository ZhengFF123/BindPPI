# BindPPI
## About
<font size=4>

BindPPI calculates the binding affinities for the protein-protein complexes to evaluate the binding strength quantitatively.It can be used for protein therapeutics discovery, de novo interface design, and computational mutagenesis.BindPPI provides four models for prediction, namely RF_{13}, MLP_{5120}, MLP_{5120///512, 13//416}, and AvgEns. For RF_{13}, MLP_{5120///512, 13//416}, and AvgEns, the input requires the 3D structure of the protein-protein complex, while MLP_{5120} only needs the sequence of the complex for computation.

### III. RUNNING BindPPI

#### For model RF_{13}
```
python BindPPI_RF13.py -i 202307091239
```
The predicted values are in the "BindPPI_RF13" column of the "202307091239.input.cleaned.outdata" file located in the output folder "202307091239_out".

#### For model MLP_{5120}
```
python BindPPI_MLP5120.py -f sample_input_sequence.json
```
The file "sample_input_sequence.json" contains input sequences. You can set the output file using the "-o" option. If not set, the predicted values file will be stored in the current directory with the default name "BindPPI_MLP5120_prediction.txt". Note: The first run will automatically download the pre-trained model ESM-2(3B), which may take some time.

#### For model MLP_{5120///512, 13//416}
```
python BindPPI_5120-512-13-416.py -i 202307091239
```
The predicted values are in the "BindPPI_MLP5120-512-13-416" column of the "202307091239.input.MLP5120-512-13-416" file located in the output folder "202307091239_out".

#### For model AvgEns
```
python BindPPI_AvgEns.py -i 202307091239
```
The predicted values are in the "BindPPI_AvgEns" column of the "202307091239.input.cleaned.outdata.average" file located in the output folder "202307091239_out".

## Platform
