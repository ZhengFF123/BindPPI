## The input files
<font size=4> 

1. 1AKJ.pdb: The 3D structure of a protein complex, which can be obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or created by the user.

2. example_1akj.input: The input file name must be consistent with the name of the input folder.

- PDBfile: coordinate file of a complex structure.
- Partner1: includes the selected protein chains for interaction partner 1 for calculation. If there are multiple chains, please separate them using periods "." (for example, A_1.B_1). If any protein/chain in the structure has one model, they are depicted with the labels of alphanumeric combinations (for example, ‘A_1’). If any protein/chain in the structure generated by applying symmetry operations has several models, they are described as ‘A_1’, ‘A_2’...;.
- Partner2: includes the selected protein chains for interaction partner 2 for calculation.

  The columns are separated by tabs.

3. example_1akj.json: Includes the protein sequences of both Partner 1 and Partner 2. The input file name must be consistent with the name of the input folder. If there are multiple chains, please separate them using commas.
